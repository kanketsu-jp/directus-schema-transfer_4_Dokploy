== Overview

This repository provides a Bash script that automates the process of transferring Directus schema (collections and fields) and file structure (folder configurations) from one Directus environment (source) to another (target). The script performs the following tasks:

* Removes any existing snapshot file on the source container so that only the latest snapshot is used.
* Retrieves a fresh schema snapshot from the source environment.
* Transfers the snapshot file from the source container to the host and then to the target container.
* Applies the snapshot in the target environment.
* Archives the uploads volume (file storage) from the source and extracts it into the target.
* Exports folder structure data (from the `directus_folders` table) and imports it into the target environment.
* Optionally redeploys the target container.

== Features

* **Automated Cleanup:** Existing `/tmp/schema.yaml` on the source container is removed so old backups are not retained.
* **Schema Transfer:** The latest schema snapshot is obtained and applied to the target environment.
* **File and Folder Migration:** Upload files are transferred via an archive of the uploads volume, and folder structure data is migrated from the `directus_folders` table.
* **Debug Logging:** Detailed logs are output when `DEBUG_MODE` is enabled.
* **Environment Validation:** The script verifies that the specified source and target containers exist.
* **Non-Destructive:** The source environment remains unchanged; only the target is modified.
* **Language Switching:** By setting the environment variable `LANG` (e.g., `LANG=ja`), you can switch the scriptâ€™s messages between English and Japanese.

== Setup and Usage

=== 1. Prerequisites

* Docker must be installed and accessible.
* Directus should be deployed using Docker containers.
* The containers must have the `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable properly set for PostgreSQL access.
* Always back up both the source and target environments before proceeding.

=== 2. Clone the Repository

1. Change to your home directory (or any working directory) and clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/directus-schema-transfer.git
----

2. Change to the repository directory:

[source,bash]
----
cd directus-schema-transfer
----

=== 3. Running the Script

If necessary, give the script execution permissions:

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x directus-migrate.sh
----

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
./directus-migrate.sh
----

You will be prompted for:
* The source environment identifier (e.g., `883409`)
* The target environment identifier (e.g., `f09f1b`)
* Whether to redeploy the target container (`y` or `n`)

== Notes

* Always back up both environments before running the migration.
* This script transfers only the Directus schema and file structure (folder configuration).
  - Image files themselves are transferred via the uploads volume archive.
  - Collection items (e.g., articles) are not migrated.
* Old snapshots and backup files are automatically removed and overwritten.
* To display messages in Japanese, set the environment variable `LANG=ja` before execution:

[source,bash]
----
LANG=ja ./directus-migrate.sh
----
